The project Open Government Data Switzerland is conducted by the [Swiss Federal Archives SFA](http://www.bar.admin.ch/themen/01648/01968/index.html?lang=en). Multiple working teams are responsible for measures set out in the OGD Strategy of Switzerland - for instance: the analysis of legal frameworks, implementation of the [opendata.swiss](http://opendata.swiss) portal, and authoring of supporting studies and documentation.

The OGD Handbook should support individuals with responsibilities for data publishing at government departments, as well as the users of OGD platforms at large. The structure of this site is based around visual and contextual representations of the process of data publishing, providing an updated resource for actual and potential data owners. Relevant documentation created as part of Open Government Data Switzerland, as well as from OGD projects around the world, will be referenced within.

We have interviewed a number of people involved in the use and publication of OGD about their organisational readiness and knowledge sharing needs. Such activities help us to be aware of best practices and facilitate more knowledge sharing between stakeholders. The OGD Handbook team continues to gather feedback with a focus on evaluating the structure, quality and usability of learning materials. Contributions on any relevant topic are welcomed.
