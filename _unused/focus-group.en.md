As part of the Information Architecture reboot of the Swiss Open Government Data (OGD) Handbook, we are planning to conduct User Research with a group of participants on the topic of the OGD portal [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss). This document describes a test plan for a *focus group*.

# Executive summary

The overall goals of usability testing include establishing a baseline of user performance, establishing and validating measures, and identifying potential design concerns to be addressed in order to improve efficiency, productivity, and end-user satisfaction. Focussed discussions in a group setting, or focus groups, are often used in the early stages of product planning and requirements gathering, as well as long after implementation. The aims are to obtain feedback about products, tasks, strategies, environments, etc., while involving a representative sample of the population of users.

The scope of the focus group is both more limited, and wider reaching, as a more informal technique to help assess "needs and feelings" through bringing together users to discuss issues and concerns about the features of a user interface. We strongly advise that it is implemented in combination with additional efforts to collect usability data, such as interviews, surveys, A/B testing and usability testing. We also recommend running more than one focus group, because the outcome of any single session may not be representative and discussions can lose focus.

This document was prepared by Oleg Lavrovsky, a software developer specialized in data and content management based on open standards.  Certified in enterprise software and usability engineering from Microsoft and Zühlke, and experienced in a large variety of online projects: from leading a software engineering team at a Fortune 500 company to assisting early-stage startups. I have contributed to building the open data community in Switzerland since 2012 as board member of the association Opendata.ch, and worked on Swiss Open Government Data projects since 2014.

# Concept

Our goal with the initial focus group will be to have at least 6 participants joining for a session of approximately 2 hours, which is run by a moderator who maintains the group's focus. The focus-group session will be experienced reasonably free-flowing and unstructured - while behind the scnes, the moderator will follow a script of specific issues (outlined below), which set goals for the type of information to be gathered.

During the group session, the moderator has the job of keeping the discussion on track without inhibiting the flow of ideas and comments. The moderator also must ensure that all group members contribute to the discussion and avoid letting one participant's opinions dominate. After the session, data analysis will be done in the form of a short report summing up the prevailing opinions and quoting individual experiences.

## Timing

The focus group should be planned ideally 2 weeks to 1 month in advance. Outreach to participants starts immediately, with a short summary communication (see [sample email](#email)) that explains the intent of the session.

Recruitment strategies for participants will be developed in concert with the portal team, to target user populations both within the project community, as well as outside of it.

A specific session time could be proposed, or a tool such as [Doodle](http://doodle.com) used to agree on the best calendar slot for the participants. The focus group session is confirmed as soon as at least 5 participants agree to join.

During this period the final plan is confirmed with the project owner, and documentation for the moderator set up. The moderator will use the preparation time to create introductory material (slides, handouts, gifts), collect links, ask any clarification questions to the project team, to test the script, and to ensure the room is reserved for the session.

Some communication with the participants can be expected ahead of the session, and as follow-up.

The focus group itself lasts 2 hours, with a reserve of one hour ahead of schedule to set up a computer for each participant, and an hour of stretch time afterwards.

Once the session has run, the moderator will compile notes, go through the audio/video recording to check quotes, and compile a report.

## Budget

The resources neeeded for a focus group, on the assumption that the participants time is voluntary, include:

- Preparation (3h)
- Moderation (4h)
- Recruitment (0.5 h p.p.)
- Workshop room and stationary (200.-)
- Refreshments (10.- p.p.)
- Thank-you gift (25.- p.p.)
- Reporting (2h)

For a focus group with 7 participants, an estimated budget based on the costs above and a moderator's fee of 125 CHF per hour, would be approximately 2'000 CHF.

# Goals

Our initial focus group will focus on three fundamental areas:

1. *How easy are the data to find*
2. *Are there enough/the right metadata to ensure needed context*
3. *Is the possibility to get in contact with the data publisher clear*

For each area, we elaborate here on potential goalposts, tasks which could be completed in 1-5 minutes by a participant, and follow-up questions for group discussion:

### 1. How easy are the data to find

We aim here at an indirect analysis of the search function and quality of the metadata presented, in terms of the effectiveness of finding datasets on the portal. This is a critical reason for the existence of such sites as catalogs for information about open data. Here we refer to opendata.swiss as *the portal*.

- In each case, describe what the dataset is about, and how you imagine using it:
  - Find a dataset with a specific title, each participant receiving a separate one from the moderator.
  - Find a dataset from an organization with a specific format.
  - Find a dataset with a specific format, keyword and license.
- Group discussion on the experience:
  - Were you successful?
  - What mechanisms did you try?
  - What frustrations did you experience?
  - What worked well?
  - What mechanisms did you not try, or were not available to you?
- Given a general topic, find a dataset that you consider to be "open", then:
  - Try to find this dataset using an external search engine (not the portal).
  - Try to find this same dataset on a *different* portal.
  - Read the dataset's description on a page *external* to the portal (such as in the dataset documentation or owner's website).
  - Discuss how effectively it is presented and catalogued.

### 2. Are there enough/the right metadata to ensure needed context

The metadata provides an overview of a dataset, as well as sharing key information such as usage terms that is not always available elsewhere. The goal of the metadata as it is presented on the portal does not mean "to know as much as possible", but instead to get from a first view an idea about what these data are and where they come from. Does the user understand from this the context in which the data is published, it's intended and possible uses, and so on.

- Each participant receives a different dataset link. They are asked to open the page, and spend one minute reading through it.
  - Is there anything missing from the metadata at first glance?
  - Describe in your own words what this dataset is about.
  - Is the context of the dataset clear? How familiar are you with this context?
  - Does the category of the dataset fit the context?
- Click on the keywords and category of the dataset.
  - Do the other datasets relate well to the first one you looked at?
  - Does anything stand out that does not seem like a good fit? Why?
  - Where else do you think the original dataset you looked at belongs?
- Download the dataset and open it on your computer.
  - Were your expectations met?
  - Did you run into any issues?
  - Having experienced the dataset first hand, what would you add to its metadata?
- Look for an application of report that uses this data.
  - How is the dataset cited or described?
  - Do you see something that was not in the metadata?
  - Has this use case altered your perception of the dataset in any way?

### 3. Is the possibility to get in contact with the data publisher clear

These are some of the main concerns in establishing a sustainable presence for open data on the portal, and creating valuable feedback loops between the users and publishers.

- Each participant receives a different dataset link. They are asked to open the page, and spend one minute reading through it.
  - Are contact options "visible" enough?
  - How does the publishers present themselves?
  - What would encourage you to share some feedback or send in a question?
  - What would *discourage* someone from doing so?
- Open the website of the publisher. Look for a reference to the dataset, if you were not given a direct link.
  - Are there contact options provided?
  - If yes, do they differ from those on the portal?
  - Would you be more or less confident to contact the publisher from this page?
  - Has your impression of the dataset changed at all after looking at the way it is presented on the publisher's site?
- A story is shared of feedback loops engendering positive improvement. Each participant is asked to select a dataset they are familiar with, which could be the same one as accessed in previous exercises.
  - What three things can you think of improving about this dataset?
  - How would you contact the publisher to ask for changes?
  - Would you contact anyone else about this?
  - Would it be appropriate if your comments were shared publicly?

## Sample interview

As a trial run of this idea, a few months ago we asked a data scientist, who was at the time new to opendata.swiss, for some additional feedback on the usability of the portal and handbook. Their comments with my highlighting and summaries:

> *I don't actually find all data sets' descriptions in all (4) languages and half in German only. I understand the data itself is in a particular language, but the descriptions should be in English if I am browsing the website in English, right? *

- data publishers shoxuld be encouraged to translate, at least using machine translation, all their metadata.

> *The field "categories" once you have clicked on a dataset entry is very strange, it seems all categories are listed instead of one or only a few to which the data actually corresponds for example [geschafte-und-berichte-kt.basel](https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/geschafte-und-berichte-regierungsrat-kanton-basel-stadt-ab-januar-2012-bis-heute). Clicking on "Go to resource" doesn't bring me to the data in some cases, just other websites. It's also strange to get HTML previews. Very nice feature to have previews for csv.*

- open formats and previews are important. Data publishers should be strongly encouraged, if not outright forced, to publish reusable datasets instead of just links to their websites.

> *Language choices should be on top in the home page.*

- again, navigating between languages is something data portals should make a priority in a multilingual country.

> *"Organizations" tab: I liked how you are 'told' to upload data in the "organizations" tab if your organization is not listed. That's easy to find. The organizations list I see is organized alphabetically. This could be an interactive map? And it is unclear why you have subcategories for some organizations and not for others. Maybe consider having numbers of data sets per organization next to the names in the list?*

- this is a great starting point to explain and navigate the portal, and could definitely use some more work.

> *"Applications": Just out of curiosity, were these made at hackathons?*

- the provenance and status of the apps (commercial product vs. community experiment) is useful for people to know.

> *FAQs: Categories are relevant. Perhaps having 8 and 9 under a theme "Publication" may help people find the OG handbook.*

- in my opinion, the FAQ should be just be a part of the Handbook. But in any case having a more readable, user friendlier FAQ would help a lot.

> *To actually find the handbook it took me at least 5 minutes clicking back and forth trying to figure out where to go... I also imagined clicking on top on the "organizations" menu in the home page and I that all government organizations would be available in a drop-down menu and then start the [publication] process.*

- interesting idea! I like the direct approach.

> *The redirection to FAQs made me think it is a mistake and that the link to uploading data is broken.*

- again, the "I want to publish data" button should go to the Handbook. Not the FAQ.

> *In the home page of the handbook there should be a short explanation of the "instructions", "edit" combo that people can find in each section. And then, reaching the edit buttons doesn't lead you to upload anything yet. I understand they get frustrated.*

- there seems to be a disconnect of purpose between people wishing to upload their data, and our wish to have contributors to the Handbook. The Handbook should be even more focused on guiding publishers through the process, with the editing process secondary.
