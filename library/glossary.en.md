#### Advanced Programming Interface (API)

A way computer programs talk to one another. Can be understood in terms of how a programmer sends instructions between programs.

#### Anonymisation

The process of adapting data so that individuals cannot be identified from it.

#### Attribution License

A licence that requires that the original source of the licensed material is cited (attributed).

#### Cloud computing

Computing services provided over the Internet (or "cloud"), whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and other devices on demand. (via [Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cloud_computing))

#### Comma Separated Values (CSV)

A very common form of text file format for sharing tabular data. The format is extremely simple and highly machine-readable.

#### Copyright

A right for the creators of creative works to restrict others’ use of those works. An owner of copyright is entitled to determine how others may use that work.

#### Data

1. (plural form of datum) Pieces of information.
2. (uncountable, collectively) Information, especially in a scientific or computational context.
3. (computing) A representation of facts or ideas in a formalized manner capable of being communicated or manipulated by some process.
(via [Wiktionary](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/data))

#### Database

A collection of information in a regular structure, usually in a machine-readable format accessible by a computer.

#### Data Access Protocol

A system that allows outsiders to be granted access to databases without overloading either system.

#### Data visualization

A modern discipline of visual communication where the goal is to communicate information clearly and efficiently to users via information graphics, such as tables and charts. Effective visualization helps users in analyzing and reasoning about data and evidence. (via [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization))

#### eXtensible Markup Language (XML)

A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format which is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is defined by the W3C's XML 1.0 Specification and by several other related specifications, all of which are free open standards. (via [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML))

#### Intellectual property rights

Monopolies granted to individuals for intellectual creations.

#### JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

An open standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML. (via [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON))

#### License

A license may be granted by a party ("licensor") to another party ("licensee") as an element of an agreement between those parties. A shorthand definition of a license is "an authorization (by the licensor) to use the licensed material (by the licensee)." (via [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License))

#### Machine-readable

Formats that are machine readable are ones which are able to have their data extracted by computer programs easily. PDF documents are not machine readable. Computers can display the text nicely, but have great difficulty understanding the context that surrounds the text.

#### Metadata

Also referred to as "data about data". There are two metadata types:

1. *structural metadata*, about the design and specification of data structures or "data about the containers of data";
2. *descriptive metadata* about individual instances of application data or the data content.

#### Open Data

Open data are able to be used for any purpose. More details can be read at [opendefinition.org](http://www.opendefinition.org/).

#### Open Government Data (OGD)

Data provided by government agencies under the Open Definition, see [Detailed defition of OGD](definition)

#### Platform

In the context of OGD we usually refer to a *computing platform* or *software platform*, such as the Web technology behind a data catalogue or other more complex multi-user applications running on a [server](#server). See: [Platform technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_technology)

#### Public domain

No copyright exists over the work.

#### Re-use

Use of content outside of its original intention.

#### Share-alike Licence

A licence that requires users of a work to provide the content under the same or similar conditions as the original.

#### Server

A computing resource used in software architecture.

#### Tab-seperated values (TSV)

A very common form of text file format for sharing tabular data. The format is extremely simple and highly machine-readable.
