Summary: The opendata.swiss portal only references and manages metadata. The primary data, as well as responsibility for publishing them, remain with the data supplier. The Federal Archives operate the portal, and also support and coordinate data publication.
---

When you publish your data on opendata.swiss, you can choose between four technical options. The following table will help you decide which option is best suited to your organization.

| Number of datasets and update frequency | Option for publication |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|
| small number of datasets, rarely updated | Option 1 – Enter metadata manually using a web form. |
| more than 10 datasets, updated regularly | Option 2 – Upload metadata manually using an XML file ([see example](/en/library/ch-dcat-ap)). |
| large number of datasets, updated frequently | Option 3 – Upload metadata automatically using a harvester. |
| spatial data already published or soon to be published on [geo.admin.ch / Federal Spatial Data Infrastructure](http://www.geo.admin.ch/internet/geoportal/en/home/geoadmin/mission/bgdi.html) | Option 4 – Upload metadata automatically using a geocat harvester. |

The data publication process will depend on the option chosen. Please discuss your choice with the Federal Archives, who will be happy to [advise you](mailto:opendata@bar.admin.ch) on selecting the right option.

Once you have chosen your option, you must prepare the metadata in the DCAT-AP standard.
