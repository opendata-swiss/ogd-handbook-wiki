# OGD Handbook wiki

Welcome to the Swiss Open Government Data Handbook

## Contributors guide

Here you will find an overview of ways to contribute to the Handbook. Notably here we will explain the editorial workflow that we have put in place to keep a high overall standard of quality. We warmly welcome comments, corrections and additions, as well as suggestions for additional topics to explore.

### Suggestions and issues

The source of the Handbook is in the central [Git repository](https://github.com/opendata-swiss/ogd-handbook-wiki) that you can also access with a Web browser. There you will find an issue tracker to submit any bugs with the content or web site.

We intend to run this project similar to how open source software is developed, and will be happy to review pull requests on your forks of the content. In order to contribute, you need to know a little bit about how this works. We are not going to go into too much detail here, but there are three components you need some understanding of:

* **GitHub**: an online hosting service, which amongst other things offers version control and code management via a web interface. We use this to keep track of changes and moderate from this [central location](https://github.com/ogdch/ogd-handbook).
* **Markdown**: is a simple markup language used to create rich documents ideal for web and print. By learning a few intuitive rules you’ll be able to ensure your text is formatted with headings, links, quotes, etc. For more information, please consult a [Markdown reference](http://en.support.wordpress.com/markdown-quick-reference/).
* **Pelican**: is open source software we use for generating a web site complete with all the layout, templates and features. This happens behind the scenes, but if you want to generate your own site you'll need to install Python and follow the instructions in our [README](https://github.com/ogdch/ogd-handbook/blob/beta-nov-2015/README.md).
